# About Falcon

This repository contains the source code for the Falcon web design, which was designed and implemented using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below, you'll find an overview of the technical details and components used in the development of this website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** The website's structure and content are built using semantic HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

- **CSS3:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were employed to define the website's layout, styles, and responsive design, ensuring a visually appealing user experience across various devices.

- **JavaScript:** JavaScript was used to enhance user interactivity and implement dynamic features such as form validation and image sliders.

## Website Structure

The website is organized into several directories and files:

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website, containing the homepage layout and content.
- `assets/`: This directory houses all css, js, media files
- `admin/`: This directory houses all admin pages
- `super-admin/`: This directory houses all super admin pages
